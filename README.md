# CookieClicker
I wanted to see how fast I could get the basic idea working and pretty enough. It displays an image, scales it by 90% if you are holding down the mouse button, and counts. It's that simple. I created an entire class just for the counter, under the assumption that I could add advanced features in the future. Not sure if that's actually going to happen :)

This is almost an empty template and this could be taken in any direction.
